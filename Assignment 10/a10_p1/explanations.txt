I commented out "using namespace std" in testcritter.cpp. and critter.cpp
These are the errors:
identifier "string" is undefined
identifier "cout" is undefined
- identifier "endl" is undefined
- identifier "cin" is undefined
- too few arguments in function call

I commented out "using namespace std" in critter.cpp
These are the errors:
declaration is incompatible with "void Critter::setName"
identifier "string" is undefined
identifier "cout" is undefined
identifier "endl" is undefined

I get these errors because the string class, the cout, cin and endl commands
are defined on namespace std.By putting std:: before the words that show errors 
I can solve these errors.

If I remove "Critter::" before getHunger() in Critter.cpp 
I get this error: identifier "hunger" is undefined
The variable hunger is declared as private in critter.h so to solve this
erroe, I should declare hunger as a public variable in critter.h.
I should put the function void getHunger() from critter.cpp
to testcritter.cpp.
